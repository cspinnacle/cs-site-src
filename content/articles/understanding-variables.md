# Understanding Variables in Programming

Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can store information.

*Think of variables as labeled boxes that store information*

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a named location in memory that stores data. Just like you might have a box labeled "toys" in your room, variables have names that help us identify what data they contain.

## Basic Example

```python
# Creating variables
name = "Alice"
age = 16
is_student = True

# Using variables
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Choose descriptive names** - `student_score` is better than `x`
2. **Follow naming conventions** - Use lowercase with underscores in Python
3. **Variables can change** - That's why they're called "variables"!

## Practice Exercise

Try creating variables for your own information:
- Your name
- Your favorite subject  
- Number of pets you have

Happy coding!
